# Master's Thesis | Jesús Bautista Villar
**"Design and integration of Guidance, Navigation and Control systems for autonomous robot swarms"**

### Abstract:

In this work, we present two innovative swarm robotics methodologies. Firstly, we propose a  collision-free path-following technique for robot swarms. We describe the fundamental principles of this methodology and provide rigorous results based on the utilization of ”control barrier functions” and ”guidance vector fields”. Through a series of simulations and experiments with an autonomous rover fleet, we demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world environments. Secondly, we introduce a resilient approach for source-seeking using robot swarms. We conduct a thorough analysis of this methodology, considering sensitivity & observability, and mechanisms for adaptation and resilience against disturbances or system failures. To validate its efficacy and robustness, we present a set of simulations that showcase the successful search for scalar field sources.

Overall, our results highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of both methodologies in real-world scenarios, providing a solid foundation for further research and advancements in swarm robotics.
